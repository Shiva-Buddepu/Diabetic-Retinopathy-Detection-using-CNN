# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-CNN
In this project, we develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect diabetic retinopathy, a severe eye condition that can lead to blindness if not treated early. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of retinal images, classified into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.
